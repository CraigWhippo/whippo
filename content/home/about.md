# About

I am a biologist with a background in plant genetics and physiology.

I work at Dickinson State University, which is a small public university in western North Dakota.  In addition to teaching an average of twelve credits each semester, I manage the university greenhouse, curate the university herbarium, mentor undergraduate-research students, and chair the General Education Council.  

I serve on the Board of Directors of the Theodore Roosevelt Nature and History Association, the Community Advisior Board of Praire Public Broadcasting, and as a cub scout den leader.

Outside of my professional and civic responsbilities, I enjoy fly fishing, fly tying, building fishing rods, brewing, hiking, and camping.
