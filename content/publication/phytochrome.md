abstract = "Red light enhances hypocotyl phototropism toward unilateral blue light through a phytochrome-mediated response. This study demonstrates how the phytochromes modulate blue-light-induced phototropism in the absence of a red light pre-treatment. It was found that phytochromes A, B, and D have conditionally overlapping functions in the promotion of blue-light-induced phototropism. Under very low blue light intensities (0.01 µmol m−2 s−1) phyA activity is necessary for the progression of a normal phototropic response, whereas above 1.0 µmol m−1 s−2 phyB and phyD have functional redundancy with phyA to promote phototropism. PhyA also contributes to attenuation of phototropism under high fluence rates of unilateral blue light, which was previously shown to be dependent on the phototropins and cryptochromes. From these results, it appears that phytochromes are required to develop a robust phototropic response under low fluence rates, whereas under high irradiances where phototropism may be less important, phyA suppresses phototropism."
