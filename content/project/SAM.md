# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Learning how to read a scientific research article is an important goal in undergraduate science education. For many students learning how to read a scientific paper is difficult because of technical jargon and the concise writing styles associated with research articles. However, most scientific research articles contain a common set of rhetorical moves based on the assumptions that scientist conduct inquiry to answer an unknown question, and that the answer is those questions are recognizible.  I am experimenting with having studends do collabrative annotations of the rhetorical moves of research articles or figures from using [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/). "
