title = "Survey of Fringe Mammals in western North Dakota"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = " The status of 22 western North Dakota mammal species is presently unknown or incomplete.  A number of ‘fringe’ mammals are thought to be associated with specific plants.    This study aims to: establish baseline survey data, determine current status and range limits, identify vegetation associations and habitat parameters, and produce updated range distribution maps of 'fringe' mammals in western North Dakota.  With little known about the distributions of these mammals, it is necessary to document their occurrences in order to understand the ecology of the region and make good management decisions."
