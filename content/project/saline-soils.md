# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Determining the factors that improve plant growth in saline soils and sodic soils is important for improving agricultural efficiency and maintaining biodiversity.   Plant genes that facilitate growth in North Dakota’s widespread saline soil are unknown.  Furthermore, information about how a host’s genotype influences the development of soil-microbial-community structure is lacking.  To do this, we will use the extensive genetic and molecular biology tools associated with the plant genetic model Arabidopsis thaliana, which includes a recently sequenced panel of 1135 natural inbred lines with over 10 million SNPs and 1.4 million small-scale indels.  This tremendous diversity panel can be used to identify genetic loci of interest using Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), which is well-suited for limitless undergraduate phenotyping projects.  GWAS evaluate the association between a single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) and phenotype of interest that is scored on a genetically diverse population.  Putative loci associated with a trait of interest can be confirmed using the publically available Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional mutants."
