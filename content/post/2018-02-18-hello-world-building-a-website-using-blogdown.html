summary: Why and how I built this website.
---



<p>When I was searching for a tenure-track position in 2010, I built a personal web page that contained a few pictures and my CV. I never really wanted to learn about css pages or html, so I built that webpage using flash using a tutorial I found online. It was OK, but I never really did anything with it after landing a TT position.</p>
<p>This website will act to document my thoughts and progress on various projects. It is generally written for myself, but hopefully it will be helpful for others.</p>
<p>To create this website, I followed <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Alison Presmanes Hill’s</a> excellent tutorial, which is written for academics like me who don’t fully understand the internal workings of web development. I strongly recommend it to others interested in creating a website.</p>
<p>I could not get the newest version of the hugo academic theme to build on netlify. So I downloaded Alison’s website repo from github and built my site from her files. The older version of the hugo-academic theme is easier to change to the color scheme and font that I wanted.</p>
